# Relational Derivation – Newtonian Two-Body System

## 1. Relational Triple Definition

We define the Newtonian two-body system as a relational triple:

TRD(m1, m2, r)

where

m1 = first mass  
m2 = second mass  
r  = relational separation  

No coordinate embedding is assumed.

## 2. Gravitational Interaction

The Newtonian gravitational force is given by

F = G m1 m2 / r^2

In relational form, this expresses a structural coupling between the product (m1 m2) and the inverse quadratic relation of r.

The interaction is therefore fully determined by the triple:

(m1, m2, r)

---

## 3. Potential Energy

The gravitational potential energy is

U = - G m1 m2 / r

This relation depends solely on structural coupling between mass product and inverse separation.

---

## 4. Circular Orbit Condition

For a circular orbit:

v^2 / r = G (m1 + m2) / r^2

which yields

v = sqrt(G (m1 + m2) / r)

---

## 5. Total Energy (Circular Orbit)

Total energy is given by

E = - G m1 m2 / (2 r)

This demonstrates structural invariance between potential and total energy:

E = U / 2

## 6. Structural Interpretation

Within the TRD representation:

- m1 and m2 define interaction strength.
- r defines relational separation.
- Energy relations emerge from structural coupling.

The system remains fully consistent with classical Newtonian mechanics while expressed purely in relational form.

## 7. Stability Domain

For r > 0:

- Force is finite.
- Energy remains bounded.
- Circular configurations satisfy classical stability conditions.

This confirms m2-consistency of the relational embedding.
