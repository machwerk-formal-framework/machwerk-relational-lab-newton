# machwerk-relational-lab-newton
This repository implements a relational formulation of Newtonian two-body mechanics using the Machwerk TRD formal core.

It provides a computational and structural framework for expressing classical gravitational dynamics in relational form. The focus is on structural invariants, energy relations, and stability analysis within established classical mechanics.

Purpose

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate that classical Newtonian dynamics can be formulated and analyzed through a relational TRD structure. The implementation provides a relational construction of the two-body gravitational system, a structural expression of energy conservation, a stability analysis of bound orbital configurations, and explicit equivalence to standard Newtonian results.

Conceptual Basis

A physical system is represented as a relational triple (TRD) of dynamically coupled quantities. For the Newtonian two-body system this is expressed as TRD(m1, m2, r). The dynamical behavior is derived from structural relations between these quantities rather than from coordinate embedding.

Repository Structure

This repository will contain core relational implementation modules, analytical derivations in document form, minimal computational examples, and structural consistency tests.

Scope

This lab operates strictly within classical mechanics and serves as a stable relational test environment for further formal development.
